              Hello world! My name is Brian Nickerson, and I'm a full stack web developer, specializing in Ruby on Rails. I'm a born-and-raised Floridian who grew up in the West Palm Beach area. Growing up, I really enjoyed playing video games, playing music in concert band, and going camping while in Boy Scouts. I can play multiple instruments (piano, trumpet, drums, others), and I've earned the rank of Eagle Scout.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduating from college, I began working for a local company doing contract and account review. I soon migrated into affiliate training, and later a product management role, where I worked with our web portal development company. While I really enjoyed creating solutions and solving problems with the programmers, I was passive in creating the solution, and felt unfulfilled with what I was doing, so I decided to change directions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a long as I can remember, I've always been passionate about problem solving, and I've had many people encourage me to become a programmer, but I felt restricted by "what I could do" or "what I was allowed to do." I realize I was creating barriers for myself, that I didn't need permission to do what I want with my life, and that I should pursue what I believe in. It's a scary prospect, and is by no means easy, which is what led me to Wyncode Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a full-stack web developer, with a focus on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  as well as how to utilize Heroku, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, and Git. I've had prior experience with Visual Basic, C#, and T-SQL, and I've worked as the product manager for my company in partnership with a web development firm.
