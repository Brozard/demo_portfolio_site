      <h1 class="title">Brian Nickerson - Wyncode Student</h1>
      <span class="right-image">
        <div>
        <p>Hello world! My name is Brian Nickerson, and I'm a student at Wyncode Academy - Fort Lauderdale Cohort 5. I'm a born-and-raised Floridian who grew up in Palm Beach Gardens. When I was younger, I was involved in music performance and Scouting, which I continued with through high school. I can play multiple instruments, including (but not limited to) piano, trumpet, and drums.
        </p>

        <p>After high school, I went to college for several years and got a Bachelor's degree - the "traditional route." I've held several project management jobs at small companies, one of which was software and web oriented, but I felt like a directionless cog in the machine of life. I found myself unfulfilled in what I was doing, and decided to change directions.
        </p>
        <p>For a long as I can remember, I've always had three things I've been passionate about: food, games (video and traditional), and problem solving. The natural conclusion was to become a programmer, but I felt restricted by what I "could" do. What I didn't realize (or didn't want to accept) is that I don't need permission to do what I want with my life, and that I should pursue what I believe in. It's a scary prospect, and is by no means easy, which is what led me to Wyncode.
