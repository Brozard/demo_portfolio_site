            Hello world! My name is Brian Nickerson, and I'm a student at Wyncode Academy - Fort Lauderdale Cohort 5. I'm a born-and-raised Floridian who grew up in Palm Beach Gardens. Growing up, I really enjoyed playing video games, playing music in concert band, and going camping while in Boy Scouts. I can play multiple instruments (piano, trumpet, drums, others), and I've earned the rank of Eagle Scout.
          </p>
          <p>
            After high school, I went to college for several years and got a Bachelor's degree - the "traditional" education route. After graduating, I got a job at small company doing contract and account review. I made a name for myself and migrated into a product management role, where I worked with our web portal development company. While I really enjoyed creating solutions and solving problems with the programmers, I was passive in creating the solution, and felt unfulfilled with what I was doing, so I decided to change directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a long as I can remember, I've always had three things I've been passionate about: food, games (video and traditional), and problem solving. I've had many people encourage me to become a programmer, but I felt restricted by what I "could" do. What I didn't realize (or didn't want to accept) is that I don't need permission to do what I want with my life, and that I should pursue what I believe in. It's a scary prospect, and is by no means easy, which is what led me to Wyncode.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently studying to be a full-stack web developer, focusing on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as how to utilize Heroku, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, and Git. I've had prior experience with Visual Basic, C#, and T-SQL, and I've worked in partnership with a web development firm as the product manager for my company.
