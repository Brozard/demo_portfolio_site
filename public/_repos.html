    Food Finder - a REPL game
  </a>
  <br/><br/>
  This program was written in one weekend. After the first week at Wyncode Academy, our class assignment was to create a simple REPL game that gave players multiple layers of multiple options. I chose to create a game where our classmates were working late over the weekend, and we needed to order food.

    Voter Sim - a CRUD REPL program
  </a>
  <br/><br/>
  This program was also written in one weekend. After the second week at Wyncode Academy, our class assignment was to create a REPL program that used classes to interact with Voters and Politicians. Our program had to be able to create, list (or read), update, and destroy Voters and Politicians, and have a menu system that would allow the user to keep going back to the main menu. I wanted to add more to my project than what the assignment called for, so I created a mock vote system.
